Detailed description of Lutron homeworks lighting control system components

In the Processors

    Processors will hold programming for ten years without power. Meaning that in the case of power loss the processor will hold all programming and all lights will return to their last state upon power return
    Processors have many communication links that can be configured for lighting control and to integrate with other sub-systems for the home including Security, Audio/Video, Heating and Air conditioning thermostats and even motors and pumps for fountains, window shades, power windows, power gates etc.
    Processors have astronomical clocks that will adjust the time for timed events. Ex: The outside lights are set to go on ½ hour before sunset. These lights will adjust to follow sunset for the location of that home
    Processors have conditional programming abilities. Ex: If the time is before 9 O’clock the bathroom lights will turn on to 90% But if the time is after 9 O’clock the lights will turn on to 25%.
    Processors can be linked to the internet so control of the system can happen from anywhere in the world via Internet connection. Ex: The homeowner is at the airport on their way home. They can connect to the internet and turn on the outside lights, turn on the entry lights, turn up the heat and start the hot tub so the house is ready for their arrival. Ex: If there is a need to change programming (light levels or add/remove lights from a scene) there is no need for a tech to come out to the house, this can be done with a phone call and a internet connection with the tech.
    Processors have an RF port. This means that you can integrate wireless keypads and switches to the system. Ex: We need a switch at the hot tub, There is power but no way to get a communication wire to the tub, wireless is a solution. Ex: The homeowner remodels 2 years after construction and wants to add keypads in the bedroom, kitchen and living room. Instead of repulling communication wire to the processor simply install wireless devices and they will integrate with the existing system.
    Lutron offers a full wireless system that can be installed into any existing home without the need for remodeling. No new wire to pull and no walls to open up. Just replace switches with Lutrons wireless switches, add keypads and a wireless processor for whole home control. You have all of the advantages of a wired homeworks system like scene control, conditional programming, astronomical clock and integration with other sub-systems

In the Relays

    The dimming modules from Lutron have Lutrons patented softswitch technology that offers extended life of the modules. Other dimming equipment on the market have an “arc” style relay that actually produces an electrical arc every time the light is turned on. This produces heat and also reduces the life of the equipment. Lutrons Softswitch technology has no arc. This increases the module life to over 1,000,000 cycles.
    Modules can dim incandescent, magnetic low voltage, electronic low voltage, cold cathode and florescent. Modules can switch lights,fans, motors and control ceiling fans.

In the Keypads

    Luton has a large selection of keypads to offer. With options like backlit stations and engraving you can customize them to whatever fits your lifestyle
    If the home is ever sold, the engraving can be redone and programming changed to fit the buyer’s life style.
